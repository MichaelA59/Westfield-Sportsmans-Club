# Status: In Progress 

This is the beginning stages of a Web App I am intending to build for the Westfield Sportsman's Club
An issue that comes up with using the facilities is that a range officer must be on duty at all times in order for various ranges to be used. They work on a volenteer basis and in 2hr blocks of time. The problem of course is that you never know if there will be one when you get there, thus risking the chance of a wasted trip. 

My plans for this Repo are as follows:

* Re-design the existing site with all static information (to be completed in React)
* Use OAuth (Facebook) for login
* Users can book a time slot
* Master schedule will be visible to all
* Users can opt into text alerts for specific timeslots using the Trello Gem

This will be completed with a Rails backend, React Front-End and Foundation

# Instructions

From the Terminal, run the following:

* `Git Clone`
* `npm install`
* `rails s`
* Open a new terminal and type in `npm start`
* Go to `localhost:3000` in your browser
